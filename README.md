## Business site - Willz models
https://willz-models.netlify.app/

This website is my contribution to Technigo bootcamps assignment: project business site. 

The aim for me while building this was to learn as much as possible while playing around and having fun with the code. Therefor I chose to make a dummy model agency site featuring my family cat Willz. My goal was to make the website look professional but with fun content. The site acts as a portfolio showing all of Willz different looks aswell as some information and a form to request a booking. It is responsive on desktop, tablet and small phones. Functioning navigation bar on desktop that turns into hamburger menu on smaller screens. 

At first glance the styling is simple and clean, but there is an option to change the vibe by turning on ”party mode” by clicking a button in the navigation bar. This was done by using javaScript.
